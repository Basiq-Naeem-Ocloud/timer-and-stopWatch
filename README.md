React Timer & Stopwatch

This project is a React-based Timer and Stopwatch application.
It demonstrates how to build real-time clock functionality using React hooks (useState, useEffect) and controlled input fields.

✨ Features:

⏳ Timer mode – set custom hours, minutes, and seconds, and count down to zero.

⏱️ Stopwatch mode – count up from 00:00:00 with pause and reset controls.

🎨 Styled UI – digital clock-like design with editable inputs that don’t look like typical input fields.

🎯 Controls – Start, Pause, and Reset buttons for both timer and stopwatch.
